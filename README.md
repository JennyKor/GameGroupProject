# GroupGameProject

<p>Top down neverending shooter made in Unity as a group project in November/December 2021. Enter the haunted castle of, uh... what was it again?</p>

<p>I was in charge of player movement/animation, map layout, points, camera movement, and enemy spawn rate. It's a bit intense, I know, but as we didn't make more levels than one due to time limit, you're supposed to eventually get overwhelmed and die.</p>
